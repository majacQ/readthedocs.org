<dd><p>A class (inheriting from <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code>) that takes
parsed documents and performs an action on them.  Normally, builders
translate the documents to an output format, but it is also possible to
use builders that e.g. check for broken links in the documentation, or
build coverage information.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="http://project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html"><span class="doc">Usage</span></a> for an overview over Sphinxâ€™s built-in
builders.</p>
